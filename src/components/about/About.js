    <h3>About invEd</h3>
    The continually rising high costs of secondary education in the US have prevented many potential students from attending or forced those who do attend into debt. 70% of students graduate college with student debt, contributing to a $1.4 trillion debt crisis.<br /><br />

    invEd provides a platform to save and fundraise for the rising costs of secondary education. Our hope is that invEd will allow more students to continue their secondary education without having to take on debt.<br /><br />
